# Home-weather-station
Home weather station which sends measurement results to WhatsApp users

We used Bme 280 to read the values of temperature, air humidity
and air pressure. We stored these values and sent them to WhatsApp using Esp8266(WiFi).
as messages. We created a ChatBot on WhatsApp, which we then retrieved via API
code, and the mobile phone number on which the ChatBot was created.
